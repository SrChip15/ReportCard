# Report Card Class Project
The class assumes the existence of Student and Teacher class. The constructor takes in arguments from the student
and/or teacher class. Report card is a final document that officially communicates the student's performance over the
course of the past academic year. So, the class is built with the finality and there are no setters for changing the
arguments initialized via the class' constructor (only one provided). Consequently, any modifications to the student's
scores or adjustments are handled at the student class object level. Further, the class also overrides the object's
toString() method and provides a better one to present the contents of the class in an appropriately formatted human-
readable string. Alternatively, the class also has a display method that presents the contents of the class per the
standard real-world report card format. 

This app has been built to the specifications of the "design a report card class" project rubric, which is part of 
the User Input module in [Udacity's Android Basics Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803).
